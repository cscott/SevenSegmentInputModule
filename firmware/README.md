Basic firmware example for initial bring-up and testing, written
in Circuit Python.

First, install [Circuit Python 8.x for the Adafruit KB2040 board](https://circuitpython.org/downloads),
which is close enough hardware-wise to our board to work.

Then copy `code.py` to the `CIRCUITPY` drive.  This is basic
code to exercise the LED driver.
