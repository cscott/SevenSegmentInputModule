v1 notes:
* need to order 100nF capacitors for front side
* should have ordered front side stencil from JLCPCB!
x should have used "real" switch footprint for boot/reset so that I could
  mount a switch for initial debugging.
* adjust LED brightness to stay within current limits?

x Should add a power transistor to turn off NEOPIXELs during sleep
  (see qtpy schematic?)
  x place capacitors for U14
x Add a DIP switch (n/p) to Gpio25 for compat w/ LED Matrix
NO ROOM Add pull-down to INTB (GPIO28), again for compat
x Remove unnecessary RESET switch footprint

* Validate max power consumption on actual hardware (once we have
  neopixels) and adjust current limiting resistor values if needed
  to honor our max 100mA limit.  (Ideally a hardware limit, so bad
  software can't force us over our limit into shutdown.  But if the
  max neopixel draw is too high we might need/use a software limit
  for neopixel brightness.)
* Check out visual appearance of hotspots etc from neopixels in
  actual practice, and adjust bezel thicknesses for better printability.
  * maybe squeeze LED digits closer together to free up side space
  * maybe we don't actually need the holes underneath the LED displays
  * maybe nudge neopixels in further from the edge
