v1 notes:
* need to order 100nF capacitors for front side
* should have ordered front side stencil from JLCPCB!
* should have used "real" switch footprint for boot/reset so that I could
  mount a switch for initial debugging.
* adjust LED brightness to stay within current limits?

* Should add a power transistor to turn off NEOPIXELs during sleep
  (see qtpy schematic?)
* Add a DIP switch (n/p) to Gpio25 for compat w/ LED Matrix
* Add pull-down to INTB (GPIO28), again for compat
