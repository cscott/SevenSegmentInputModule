v1 notes:
* need to order 100nF capacitors for front side
* should have ordered front side stencil from JLCPCB!
x should have used "real" switch footprint for boot/reset so that I could
  mount a switch for initial debugging.
* adjust LED brightness to stay within current limits?

x Should add a power transistor to turn off NEOPIXELs during sleep
  (see qtpy schematic?)
  x place capacitors for U14
x Add a DIP switch (n/p) to Gpio25 for compat w/ LED Matrix
NO ROOM Add pull-down to INTB (GPIO28), again for compat
x Remove unnecessary RESET switch footprint

* Validate max power consumption on actual hardware (once we have
  neopixels) and adjust current limiting resistor values if needed
  to honor our max 100mA limit.  (Ideally a hardware limit, so bad
  software can't force us over our limit into shutdown.  But if the
  max neopixel draw is too high we might need/use a software limit
  for neopixel brightness.)
* Check out visual appearance of hotspots etc from neopixels in
  actual practice, and adjust bezel thicknesses for better printability.
  * maybe squeeze LED digits closer together to free up side space
  * maybe we don't actually need the holes underneath the LED displays
  * maybe nudge neopixels in further from the edge

* Switch to 0.4mm PCB to fix thickness issue
  (an alternative is a two board stackup to drop the board further into the
  well, which could recover another 0.4mm of space but still requires the
  bottom board to be 0.4mm thick.  The bezel would be an additional ~0.8mm
  tall, though and could include the top edge alignment feature)
  Stack would be:
    0.5mm clearance below the PCB (maybe need foam, suggested 0.6mm/24mil foam)
    0.4mm PCB
    2.1mm LED display
    0.1mm ND film (1ply is 1.5mil = 0.04mm. 0.1mm is ~4mil)

  Compared to 3.1 (=2.35+0.75) for indicated thickness to input deck surface
